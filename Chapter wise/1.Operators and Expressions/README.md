- Real-world loop and update use cases

---

### 7. 🧠 `logical.c`
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates logical operators used in decision-making.

**Operators Covered:**  
- Logical AND (`&&`), Logical OR (`||`), Logical NOT (`!`)

**Concepts:**  
- Conditional checks  
- Combining multiple conditions

---

### 8. 🧮📐 `operator_precedence.c`
**Purpose:**  
Shows how operator precedence affects evaluation order.

**Concepts:**  
- Precedence and associativity  
- Writing expressions that behave as expected

---

### 9. 📊 `relational.c`
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates relational operators.

**Operators Covered:**  
- Equal to (`==`), Not equal to (`!=`)  
- Greater than (`>`), Less than (`<`)  
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`), Less than or equal to (`<=`)

**Concepts:**  
- Comparing values  
- Essential for conditions and control flow

---

### 10. 📦 `sizeof.c`
**Purpose:**  
Finds the size of different data types using the `sizeof` operator.

**Concepts:**  
- Understanding memory size of variables  
- Portable code and memory management

---

### 11. ❓ `ternary.c`
**Purpose:**  
Uses the ternary operator to find the maximum of two numbers.

**Operator Covered:**  
- Ternary (`condition ? true : false`)

**Concepts:**  
- Writing concise decision-making code  
- Replacing simple `if-else` logic

---

### 12. 🔄 `type_casting.c`
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates implicit and explicit type casting.

**Concepts:**  
- Type conversion between `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.  
- Preventing data loss  
- Controlling precision

---
