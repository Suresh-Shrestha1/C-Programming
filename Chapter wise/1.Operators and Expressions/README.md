### 2. 📝 `assignment.c`
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates assignment and compound assignment operators.

**Operators Covered:**  
- Assignment (`=`)  
- Compound (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`)

**Concepts:**  
- Updating values efficiently  
- Reducing code verbosity

---

### 3. ⚙️ `bitwise.c`
**Purpose:**  
Shows how bitwise operations work.

**Operators Covered:**  
- AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`)  
- Left Shift (`<<`), Right Shift (`>>`)

**Concepts:**  
- Bit-level manipulation  
- Flags and low-level optimization

---

### 4. ➕➕ `comma.c`
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates the use of the comma operator.

**Concepts:**  
- Evaluating multiple expressions in a single statement  
- Useful in `for` loops and complex expressions

---

### 5. 🧮 `expression.c`
**Purpose:**  
Evaluates a complex arithmetic expression combining multiple operators.

**Concepts:**  
- Operator precedence  
- Associativity  
- Proper use of parentheses

---

### 6. 🔼🔽 `increment_decrement.c`
**Purpose:**  
Illustrates pre and post increment/decrement.

**Operators Covered:**  
- Pre-increment (`++var`)  
- Post-increment (`var++`)  
- Pre-decrement (`--var`)  
- Post-decrement (`var--`)

**Concepts:**  
- Subtle differences in prefix vs postfix  
- Real-world loop and update use cases

---

### 7. 🧠 `logical.c`
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates logical operators used in decision-making.

**Operators Covered:**  
- AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), NOT (`!`)

**Concepts:**  
- Conditional checks  
- Combining multiple conditions

---

### 8. 🧮📐 `operator_precedence.c`
**Purpose:**  
Shows how operator precedence affects evaluation order.

**Concepts:**  
- Precedence and associativity  
- Writing expressions that behave as expected
