# ðŸ§± Chapter 8: Structures and Unions in C

This workspace contains several C programs demonstrating the use of **structures**, **unions**, **bit fields**, **pointers**, **arrays**, and **memory usage** in C programming. Each file includes a self-contained example with code and comments illustrating a specific concept.

Ideal for learners who want to understand how to organize complex data using structures and how unions manage memory efficiently.

## ðŸ“‚ List of Programs

### 1. ðŸ“˜ `structure.c`
**Purpose:**  
Defines a `Student` structure and displays roll number, name, and marks.

**How It Works:**  
- Declares a structure with multiple fields  
- Accepts user input  
- Uses a loop to print the marks

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Structure declaration  
- Accessing members  
- Basic input/output with structures

---

### 2. ðŸ§¾ `structure_array.c`
**Purpose:**  
Uses an **array of structures** to store details of multiple students.

**How It Works:**  
- Declares an array of `Student` structures  
- Takes input for each student  
- Prints student details using a loop

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Array of structures  
- Structure iteration  
- Batch input/output

### 3. ðŸ“š `structure_pointer.c`
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates how to use a **pointer to a structure**.

**How It Works:**  
- Declares a `Book` structure  
- Uses a pointer to access and display members

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Pointers and structures  
- `->` operator for member access  
- Efficient data handling
