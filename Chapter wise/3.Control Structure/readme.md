# 🔁 Chapter 3: Control Structure Programs in C

This repository contains simple C programs demonstrating various control structures. Each program focuses on a specific concept, making it easy for beginners to understand how control flow works in C.

## 📂 List of Programs

### 1. ✅ `if.c`
**Purpose:**  
Checks if a number entered by the user is positive using an `if` statement.

**Concept:**  
- Introduces the simplest form of decision-making.
- Executes a block only if a condition is true.

---

### 2. 🔄 `if_else.c`
**Purpose:**  
Determines if a number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.

**Concept:**  
- Handles two possible outcomes.
- Demonstrates binary decision making.

---

### 3. 📊 `if_else_if.c`
**Purpose:**  
Compares two numbers and prints which one is greater or if they are equal.

**Concept:**  
- Shows multiple conditional branches using `if-else-if`.

---

### 4. ➕ `for_loop.c`
**Purpose:**  
Displays the multiplication table of a number using a `for` loop.

**Concept:**  
- Demonstrates counter-controlled loops.
- Ideal when number of iterations is known.

---

### 5. 🔁 `while_loop.c`
**Purpose:**  
Prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop.

**Concept:**  
- Entry-controlled loop.
- Useful for conditions that may or may not run at all.

---

### 6. 🔄 `do_while_loop.c`
**Purpose:**  
Displays a simple menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.

**Concept:**  
- Exit-controlled loop.
- Ensures the loop runs at least once.

---

### 7. 🚫 `break.c`
**Purpose:**  
Uses `break` to exit a loop when the number 5 is found.

**Concept:**  
- Immediately terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch.

---

### 8. ⏭️ `continue.c`
**Purpose:**  
Skips printing the number 5 in a loop using `continue`.

**Concept:**  
- Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.

---

### 9. 🪂 `goto.c`
**Purpose:**  
Jumps to a labeled section of the code when a condition is met.

**Concept:**  
- Demonstrates unconditional jump using `goto` (use with caution).

---

### 10. 🔁🔍 `nested_loop_if.c`
**Purpose:**  
Prints even numbers between 1 and 10 using a loop and an `if` condition.

**Concept:**  
- Combines control structures: nesting a condition inside a loop.

---

### 11. 🔢 `switch_case.c`
**Purpose:**  
Performs basic arithmetic operations using a `switch` statement.

**Concept:**  
- Cleaner alternative to multiple `if-else-if` chains.
- Selects code block to execute based on value.

## 🎯 Purpose and Learning Outcomes
These programs are designed for educational purposes to help you:
- Understand the flow of control in C programs.
- Learn how to make decisions and execute conditional logic.
- Practice loops: for, while, and do-while.
- Use control jump statements like break, continue, and goto.
- Explore structured branching using switch-case.

By mastering these control structures, you'll be well-equipped to build logic-driven C programs and move on to more advanced programming tasks.
