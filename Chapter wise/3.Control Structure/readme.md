## 📂 List of Programs

### 1. ✅ `if.c`
**Purpose:**  
Checks if a number entered by the user is positive using an `if` statement.

**Concept:**  
- Introduces the simplest form of decision-making.
- Executes a block only if a condition is true.

---

### 2. 🔄 `if_else.c`
**Purpose:**  
Determines if a number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.

**Concept:**  
- Handles two possible outcomes.
- Demonstrates binary decision making.

---

### 3. 📊 `if_else_if.c`
**Purpose:**  
Compares two numbers and prints which one is greater or if they are equal.

**Concept:**  
- Shows multiple conditional branches using `if-else-if`.

---

### 4. ➕ `for_loop.c`
**Purpose:**  
Displays the multiplication table of a number using a `for` loop.

**Concept:**  
- Demonstrates counter-controlled loops.
- Ideal when number of iterations is known.

---

### 5. 🔁 `while_loop.c`
**Purpose:**  
Prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop.

**Concept:**  
- Entry-controlled loop.
- Useful for conditions that may or may not run at all.

---

### 6. 🔄 `do_while_loop.c`
**Purpose:**  
Displays a simple menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.

**Concept:**  
- Exit-controlled loop.
- Ensures the loop runs at least once.

---

### 7. 🚫 `break.c`
**Purpose:**  
Uses `break` to exit a loop when the number 5 is found.

**Concept:**  
- Immediately terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch.
