# 🧭 Chapter 7: Pointers in C

This folder contains various C programs that demonstrate key **pointer concepts** and **dynamic memory allocation** techniques. These examples cover how pointers interact with variables, arrays, strings, and memory, offering a solid foundation for mastering pointers in C.

Ideal for beginners and intermediate learners who want to gain hands-on experience with pointers, memory addresses, and dynamic allocation in C.

## 📂 List of Programs

### 1. 🧾 `delare_initialize_pointer.c`  
**Purpose:**  
Declares a pointer, initializes it with the address of a variable, and accesses data using the pointer.

**How It Works:**  
- Uses a simple integer variable  
- A pointer holds its address  
- Prints value and address using the pointer

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Pointer declaration  
- Dereferencing  
- Address-of operator (`&`)

---

### 2. 🔁 `swap_diigits.c`  
**Purpose:**  
Swaps two integers using a function that takes pointers as parameters.

**How It Works:**  
- Passes variable addresses to a function  
- Swaps their values via pointer dereferencing

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Function with pointer arguments  
- Data manipulation through addresses

---

### 3. 🧩 `pointer_to_pointer.c`  
**Purpose:**  
Explores **pointer to pointer** (double pointer) usage.

**How It Works:**  
- Uses a basic variable, a pointer, and a double pointer  
- Shows how to access data via multiple levels of indirection

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Pointer to pointer (`**`)  
- Multi-level dereferencing

---

### 4. 🧵 `arrays_pointer.c`  
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates an **array of pointers to strings**.

**How It Works:**  
- Stores multiple strings using pointers  
- Iterates and prints them using pointer indexing

**Concepts Covered:**  
- String arrays using pointers  
- Traversing arrays of string literals
