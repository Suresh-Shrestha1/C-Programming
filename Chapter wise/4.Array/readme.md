# 📚 Chapter 4: Array Programs in C

This workspace contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use of **arrays** — a fundamental data structure in C. These examples cover array declaration, initialization, traversal, searching, sorting, and matrix handling.

Perfect for beginners and intermediate learners looking to strengthen their understanding of one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays in C.

## 📂 List of Programs

### 1. 📦 `initilialize_declare.c`
**Purpose:**  
Declares and initializes a one-dimensional array, then prints all its elements.

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Array declaration and definition  
- Initialization with values  
- Traversal using loops (`for` loop)

**Why It Matters:**  
Understanding how arrays work is essential for managing collections of data efficiently.

### 2. 🔍 `linear_search.c`
**Purpose:**  
Searches for a user-provided number in an array using the **linear search** technique.

**How It Works:**  
- Accepts an array of numbers  
- Prompts the user to enter a number to search  
- Checks each element one by one until a match is found or the end is reached

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Searching algorithms  
- Conditional statements (`if`)  
- Looping (`for`/`while`)

**Use Case:**  
Useful when the array is small or unsorted.

### 3. 🫧 `bubble_sort.c`
**Purpose:**  
Sorts a one-dimensional array using the **bubble sort** algorithm.

**How It Works:**  
- Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order  
- Repeats this process until the array is sorted

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Nested loops  
- Element swapping  
- Basic sorting logic

**Tip:**  
Great starting point to understand sorting mechanics and time complexity.

### 4. 🔽 `selsection_sort.c`
**Purpose:**  
Sorts an array using the **selection sort** algorithm.

**How It Works:**  
- Finds the minimum element in the unsorted part  
- Swaps it with the first unsorted element  
- Repeats this process for all positions

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Searching for minimum  
- Index manipulation  
- In-place sorting

**Note:**  
Simple but not the most efficient for large datasets.
