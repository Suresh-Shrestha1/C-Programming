# üíª C Programming Classwise Examples

Welcome to the **C Programming Classwise Examples** repository!  
This collection is designed to help students and beginners learn C programming through practical, class-based examples. Each folder represents a class session, covering fundamental concepts, hands-on problems, and their solutions.

---

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **Class 1**: Basic syntax, arithmetic operations, average calculation, area/circumference, interest, percentage, odd/even checks.
- **Class 2**: Expressions, equations, swapping values, maximum number (if-else and ternary), odd/even checker.
- **Class 3**: Loops (for), factorial, increment/decrement patterns, grading, largest/smallest/odd/even.
- **Class 4**: Control statements (switch, while, for), palindrome, reverse number, Fibonacci series, vowel/consonant checker.
- **Class 5**: Arrays, patterns with nested loops, array length, changing elements, arithmetic with switch, 3D arrays.
- **Class 6**: Functions (basic, with/without return, recursion), calculator, min/max in arrays, multiple functions.
- **Class 7**: Pointers, swapping with pointers, sum with pointers, largest with pointers, sum of array elements using pointers.
- **Class 8**: File handling (create, read, write, append, copy content, print content).
- **Class 9**: Structures (student records, book records, sorting, filtering by address/marks, pointer to structure).

## üö¶ How to Use

1. **Browse by Class**:  
   Navigate to the desired class folder to find relevant C programs.

2. **Compile and Run**:  
   Use any standard C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and run the `.c` files:
   ```sh
   gcc filename.c -o filename
   ./filename
   ```

3. **Experiment and Learn**:  
   Each file is commented for clarity. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

## üìù Example Topics Covered

- Input/output operations
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`)
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`)
- Arrays and multidimensional arrays
- Functions (with/without return, recursion)
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Structures and structure arrays
- File handling (read/write/append/copy)
- Sorting and filtering data

## üìö Tips

- Some files use hardcoded array sizes or fixed numbers for demonstration.
- File paths in file handling examples may need adjustment based on your system.
- The code is intended for educational purposes and may not handle all edge cases.
